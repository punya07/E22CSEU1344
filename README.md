# Social Media Analytics API

This is a Node.js-based microservice that fetches social media analytics data such as:

- Top 5 users by number of posts
- Latest 5 posts
- Most popular posts (by comment count)
- Comments for a specific post

## Current Status

Originally structured using MVC, but currently working from a single `app.js` file for simplicity and easier testing.
